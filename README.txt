usm - unix site manager

The simplest static site generator possible.

It can host anything from blogs, too shops,
too link-agragators, to literally any type of
website ever, while being an extensible tool
which follows the unix phliosophy.

This is a basic scripting template for creating
beautiful static webpages with dynamicly updating
content using nothing but unix tools.

All it does is set some varables, and then runs
all scripts in the directory tree, its incredibly
simple.
