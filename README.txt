usm - unix site manager
_______________________________________________________________________________

Usm is an exsensable static website "manager" that can host anything from
blogs, to shops, to link-agragators, to literally any type of website ever,
while being an extensible tool which follows the unix phliosophy.

It's a basic scripting template for creating beautiful static webpages with
dynamicly updating content using nothing but unix tools.

All it does is set some varables, and then runs all .sh scripts in the
directory, its incredibly simple.
