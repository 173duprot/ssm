[1.0] Description

Usm is an exsensable static website "manager" that can host anything from
blogs, to shops, to link-agragators, to literally any type of website ever,
while being an extensible tool which follows the unix phliosophy.

It's a basic scripting template for creating beautiful static webpages with
dynamicly updating content using nothing but unix tools.
